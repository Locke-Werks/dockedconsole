# Embed an application manifest as a FILE, never as a link-line value.
#
# Copied from Forge's cmake/LwiManifest.cmake, comment included, because the
# comment is the valuable part. /MANIFESTUAC takes a value containing spaces and
# single-quoted attributes, which must be double-quoted for the linker, and CMake
# re-quotes target_link_options on the way through. What reached the linker in
# DeadLetter was a manifest whose attribute NAMES had been swallowed, so the
# binary carried invalid XML and Windows refused to start it with "side-by-side
# configuration is incorrect".
#
# :NO is deliberate. It stops the linker generating its own manifest, which would
# then be merged with, and could contradict, the one being embedded. This matters
# here: app.manifest is what makes the process PerMonitorV2 before any of our code
# runs, and every AppBar coordinate in this program is a physical pixel.
